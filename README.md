# NN Image

Just an image I use to develop Python projects in VSCode.

You should have [NVIDIA drivers](https://github.com/roworu/nvidia-fedora-secureboot) and [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) installed before building.
Guide for installingh CUDA Toolkit [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux).
