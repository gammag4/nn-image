# NN Image

Just an image I use to develop Python projects in VSCode.

You should have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), [NVIDIA Drivers](https://github.com/roworu/nvidia-fedora-secureboot) and [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) installed before building.
