i was trying to build open3d and open3d-ml from source here
in order to be able to build this, you will probably have to install cuda toolkit in the docker image
but im done with this for now
for now only use draw_plotly in open3d

although a specific version of cuda-toolkit seems to be installed
but it does not have the static files for cusolver, only dynamic ones
so maybe try to find how to compile it dynamically?
